              Educational Insight's associates are available for consultation regarding your child or adolescent. Consultations are single or periodic sessions that generally last ninety minutes. Consultations may cover the following topics:
            </p>

            <ul>
             <li> Reviewing prior testing results </li>
             <li> Providing a second opinion regarding the results of an evaluation </li>
             <li> Determining the appropriateness of a learning plan (e.g., 504 or IEP) </li>
             <li> Updating progress after an evaluation </li>
             <li> Determining if an evaluation is needed </li>
             <li> Clarifying if further outside professional support is needed (e.g., whether counseling or a medication evaluation are appropriate) </li>
             <li> Suggesting appropriate resources for your family </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
 At the end of a consultation, we help determine what services would meet your child's needs. Many times no testing or only limited testing is needed; however, some children may need a comprehensive battery of tests. Generally, it is better to schedule all of the appointments for an evaluation at the onset rather than scheduling a single consultation. After the first meeting, it is always easy to cancel the remaining appointments if they are no longer needed.
