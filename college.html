              Many high school students need an evaluation to determine eligibility for testing accommodations or placement in learning assistance programs. In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, students with disabilities may qualify for accommodations during standardized testing (e.g., SAT, ACT and AP). The guiding principle is that only with these accommodations would the tests accurately reflect the student's true abilities and knowledge. The following are common test accommodations:
            </p>

            <ul>
             <li> Extended testing time </li>
             <li> Additional rest breaks </li>
             <li> Selectable background and foreground colors </li>
             <li> Test reader </li>
             <li> Recorder or writer of answers </li>
             <li> Sign language interpreter for spoken directions </li>
             <li> Braille, large print or or audio formats </li>
           </ul>

            <p>
              Some colleges offer comprehensive programs for students with disabilities. These colleges have staff that specialize in disabilities and often offer courses in areas such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
             <li> College survival skills and career planning </li>
             <li> Study skills and time management </li>
             <li> Developmental reading and writing skills </li>
             <li> Note taking and research paper skills </li>
             <li> Stress management and social skills </li>
             <li> Computer skills and dictation </li>
             <li> Self-advocacy skills </li>
           </ul>

            <p>
              Educational Insight can document a wide range of disabilities (attentional, emotional, learning, etc). We follow the guidelines set forth by the Educational Testing Service and American Psychological Association to ensure quality and comprehensiveness.
